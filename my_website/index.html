               <p>I'm Michele Gaidelis, a dedicated and experienced IT professional who enjoys trying new things, like this personal website.</p>
               <p>An attitude of continuous learning and improvement is one of the main ingredients of a successful career in IT.</p>
               <p>This is even more true if you decide to move into the world of IT Management.</p>
               <p>So, here I am, making sure I understand the parts of IT that I'm weak at.</p>

               <p>I've been in IT a long time. This is my first time setting up a CI/CD environment. :-)</p>
               <p>I also have not setup a personal website without a template since I was in school! This will be super fun. :-D</p>
               <p>Constructive criticism is welcome, as are complements! Ha!</p>
               <p>I'm excited to see where this little project takes me...</p>
